A Full Stack App in Vue.js and Express.js tutorial by `Cody Seibert`.

# Client

A Vue.js project

# Server

An Express project

# Build Setup

Running in two terminal windows, for the client and server, *install* then *start* the application. Namely,

for the client,

```bash
cd client
yarn install
yarn start
```

and similarly for the server,

```bash
cd server
yarn install
yarn start
```

# Comments

My version of the application follows the `FreeCodeCamp` tutorial fairly closely, however, some things I modified according to my own preference. In particular, I chose not to *seed* the sqlite database using JS. Instead I used `DB Browser for SQLite` and SQL statements to complete that task (it's good to practice :-).
